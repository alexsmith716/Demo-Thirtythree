# Demo-Thirtythree

### ABOUT:

* Using Babel CLI for Server compile.

* Addressing the `require`ing of static assets server/Node side via babel with `css-modules-require-hook`.
* Only enabling usage of `css-modules-require-hook` for testing with `graphiql`.
* Tried several approaches using babel & LC for server side rendering static assets but none really worked so going with this.
* Pretty sure this usage of LC for SSR is correct but must say not 100% positive!
